        <p>Online scams are everywhere — phishing emails, fake logins, ransomware, and extortion schemes. Sometimes the attackers aren't sophisticated cybercriminals. Sometimes they're just <em>script kiddies</em> — amateurs who copy tools they don't fully understand.</p>
        <p>Here's the story of how one of them tried to extort me for <strong>$200 in Bitcoin</strong>, what happened to a friend who tested the file in a VM, and what you can do to stay safe.</p>

        <h3>The Bitcoin extortion email</h3>
        <blockquote>
          "you have to pay 200 dollars if you want ur stuffs back and stay alone"
        </blockquote>
        <p>The sender called themselves <code>yakuza haha</code>. Instead of panicking, I replied with short, unhelpful answers like "why?" or "I have to go back to work." The intimidation fell apart quickly — there was no real leverage behind the threats.</p>

        <h3>Inside the extortion emails</h3>
        <p>Here's a snapshot of the actual exchange I had with the scammer:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>Scammer:</strong> "You have to pay 200 dollars if you want your stuffs back and stay alone."</p>
          <p><strong>Me:</strong> "Why?"</p>
          <p><strong>Scammer:</strong> "Are you going to pay or not?"</p>
          <p><strong>Me:</strong> "I have to go back to work."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>That was the entire level of sophistication. No technical detail, no leverage — just repetition and pressure. It shows how these scams work: they hope fear will do the job for them.</p>

        <h3>When my friend got caught anyway</h3>
        <p><strong>One of my friends did get scammed by the same person.</strong> He opened the malicious file inside a <strong>virtual machine (VM)</strong> — a sandbox many tech folks use to test suspicious software — and still ran into issues. He trusted me. So he ran it on his own computer because on the VM it wasn't working.... Moral of the story: even if you're being careful, things can go wrong. You really gotta be careful. Don't trust your friends online with files! </p>

        <h3>What is a VM?</h3>
        <p>A <strong>Virtual Machine</strong> is basically a computer inside your computer. It creates a sandboxed environment where software runs isolated from your main system. It helps — but it isn't a silver bullet. Some malware can detect VMs or exploit misconfigurations. Learn more on
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Lessons learned</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Don't panic, don't pay.</strong> Fear is the whole playbook. Paying once marks you as a target.</li>
          <li><strong>Harden accounts.</strong> Use a password manager, unique passwords, and 2FA everywhere.</li>
          <li><strong>Backups win.</strong> Regular offline backups beat ransomware and extortion.</li>
          <li><strong>VMs are magic.</strong> Useful, yes. Perfect, no. Treat them as one layer of defense.</li>
          <li><strong>Document everything.</strong> Save emails, headers, screenshots, and file hashes if possible.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tracking the scammer</h3>
        <p>The attacker wasn't very smart about covering their tracks. From my account security logs, I could see a <strong>successful sign-in from Turkey</strong> (IP address: <code>88.230.180.122</code>, using Chrome on Windows). They even passed part of a password reset challenge — proof this wasn't just empty threats.</p>
        <p>I reported the incident to the police, but unfortunately, <strong>nothing came of it</strong>. The case went nowhere.</p>
        <p>The Turkish Police told me to contact the Turkish Consulate, which then told me to contact Turkish lawyers… it was never-ending. Lawyers never replied, and this is where it stands today: unreplied e-mails.</p>
        <p>I warned my friends, so they removed my accounts from Discord and put me on silence on various platforms. <strong>If you get hacked on one platform, make sure you can still reach your friends on others</strong> — that way you can alert them, secure your account, and protect others from being scammed by your compromised profile.</p>
        <p>On the bright side, I also reported the <strong>fake website hosting their malicious application</strong>, and the hosting provider did take it down. At least one door was closed on this scammer.</p>

        <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
        <p>In my case, the scammer failed. But my friend's experience is a reminder: even clumsy attacks can waste time or cause damage. Stay skeptical, keep things simple, and secure the basics — they matter the most.</p>
