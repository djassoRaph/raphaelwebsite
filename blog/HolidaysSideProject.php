        <p>Sigh, summer is soon over. I've been working on side projects a lot. I've suffered a lot with the GPT 4o to GPT 5.</p>
        <p>It just didn't work out</p>
        <p>I moved over to Claude.ai for now, and it did great.</p>
        <p>I've had a side project on Godot for a couple of weeks now it was working on python, great with GPT4o but to get it to work on Godot...</p>
        <p>It just never clicked and failed multiple times.</p>
        <p>I tried three days in a row with GPT. And did it in with Claude in the end and it finally works.</p>
        <p>What took 3 days to fail with GPT, worked with Claude in one !</p>
