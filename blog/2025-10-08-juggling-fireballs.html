        <p class="callout">What do you do when your team of two becomes a team of one, and the projects are on fire?</p>

        <p>For the last couple of weeks, I've been flying solo. My partner in crime, my "working buddy," is out dealing with a situation I know many of us face: burnout.</p>

        <p>I’m doing my best to support him, but in the meantime, the work doesn't stop. It feels like I’ve been handed a set of fireballs to juggle. And they’re all different sizes. Each one represents a project, a client, or a critical deadline. One was a priority, an emergency, a bug that had to be fixed ASAP. It took everything to put out that fire. But it's done. Extinct. Doused in cold water.</p>

        <p>Two are still burning. I’m doing my best to keep them in the air and not drop them. Delivering as much as I can, without compromising quality, but I know they won’t be extinguished as fast as the first one was. I need to be transparent about what's achievable.</p>
        
        <p>This situation reminds me of something crucial: real expertise isn’t just about putting out fires. But it’s about the grace and calm you bring when you find yourself in the middle of a crisis you didn’t create.</p>

        <h2>Navigating a Solo Mission</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Prioritization:</strong> When everything is urgent, nothing is. I had to identify the one true emergency and focus all my energy on it. The rest can wait, and I've communicated that clearly.</li>
          <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Over-communication is key here. I'm regularly updating my boss on the status of our current projects, managing expectations, and being honest about what is and isn't possible.</li>
          <li><strong>Self-Compassion:</strong> I'm reminding myself that I am only one person. I can’t do the work of two at the same pace. This is a marathon, not a sprint.</li>
          <li><strong>Title and Responsibility:</strong> Requesting a title change, to better reflect my responsibilities and the value I bring to the table. It’s not just about the work I do, but the expertise and holding the line.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It’s easy to feel overwhelmed, to want to rush, to make a mistakes... learn and reiterate... But what I'm learning is the value of a steady hand. The ability to slow down, take a breath, and tackle each problem with a calm focus.</p>
        
        <p>With this current circus my headspace really went into a state of flow. And I was really productive to turn off the fire on one project and now working to finish the other.</p>
        
        <h2>The Claude Conundrum</h2>
        
        <p>On another note, my reliance on AI tools has been tested. I've ran into the weekly quota limits with Claude, and it’s incredibly frustrating. It feels like hitting a wall just when I'm in my flow state, just when I need a partner the most. This experience reinforces a truth about these tools: they're not a substitute for core skills, but an augmentation of them. And when they fail, your foundational knowledge is all you have left.</p>
        
        <p> Should I build my own LLM ? </p>

        <p>It’s a powerful reminder of digital sovereignty. The tools you own and control—your own code, your own knowledge—are the only ones you can rely on completely. All others can fail you in a critical moment. It's a waste of time and energy trying to circumvent those limitations. At least I've found a way around this particular problem with the help of Gemini. But I still need to be able to trust my tools. I'll be more mindful of this in the future.</p>

        <p>This experience is teaching me how to be a better developer, a more disciplined consultant, and a more resilient individual. And for that, I am grateful.</p>
