        <p class="callout">Being productive on too many “frontlines” can make you immobile, especially when others expect instant results.</p>

        <p>Right now, my life is stretched between training for my first Dan in Aikido, juggling side projects, investing in my relationship, staying on top of my day job, and just keeping my old car alive long enough to replace it. That’s already a full schedule before unexpected things come along.</p>

        <p>I recently made a deal with a colleague on a side project. I wanted to contribute, but my pace didn’t match his. He needed an “instant” app, desktop-first. I pushed for mobile-first. We ended up clashing over expectations. The contradiction wasn’t technical—it was about priorities.</p>

        <p>The truth is: expertise doesn’t equal availability. I can bring value and skill, but I can’t bend time. Some people want results right away. Others understand the slower process. That mismatch often decides whether collaborations survive.</p>

        <p>So here’s the lesson I’m learning: I can’t make everyone happy. I want to become who I choose to become, and that takes process, discipline, and focus. Sometimes that means letting opportunities go if they don’t align with my priorities.</p>

        <h2>What I’m reminding myself of</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Favor small, iterative wins over big, instant results.</li>
          <li>Say “no” without guilt. It’s how you protect the promises that matter.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Training for your first Dan teaches you something crucial: progress happens through consistent, focused effort over time. You can't rush a black belt by training 16 hours one day and skipping the rest of the week.</p>
        <p>
            On a related note, Eric S. Raymond once wrote in his classic essay 
        <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
             “How To Become A Hacker”
        </a>
        that many hackers also practice martial arts — not because it’s “tough,” 
        but because it cultivates the same kind of mental discipline and 
        awareness you need in hacking. That resonates with me. 
        Training for my first Dan in Aikido is part of the same process: 
        refining focus, patience, and deliberate practice.
        </p>
        <p>The same principle applies to professional development. You can't build a sustainable career by saying yes to every urgent request and burning out every few months. Real mastery—whether in martial arts or software development—requires the discipline to say no to shortcuts.</p>
        <p>Will my colleague return? I hope so. If not, it’s not failure — it’s clarity. My schedule is packed, but it’s also pointed toward the person I want to be. And that matters more than saying yes to everything.</p>

        <p><em>You can’t get them all. But you can get the right ones.</em></p>
