        <h2>Holidays and side projects.</h2>

          <p>Sigh, summer is soon over. I've been working on side projects a lot. I've suffered a lot with the GPT 4o to GPT 5.</p>
          <p>It just didn't work out</p>
          <p>I moved over to Claude.ai for now, and it did great.</p>
          <p>I've had a side project on Godot for a couple of weeks now it was working on python, great with GPT4o but to get it to work on Godot...</p>
          <p>It just never clicked and failed multiple times.</p>
          <p>I tried three days in a row with GPT. And did it in with Claude in the end and it finally works.</p>
          <p>What took 3 days to fail with GPT, worked with Claude in one !</p>

        <h2>Productivity. And debugging.</h2>
        <p><em><time datetime="2025-07-30">Posted on July 31, 2025</time></em></p>
        <div>
          <p>So I've been working on automatically updateing my blog simply by doing a git push.</p>
          <p>This launches a workflow on my github. Then pushes everything to my FTP via a script.</p>
            <p>I'll have to study it.</p>
            <p> Because I just bindly thought it would do bash scripts, but no, it's calling some one elses script.</p>
          <p>Being on holiday does give you the time to work on your side projects ! Lets go ! </p>

        <h2>CET headaches again. And procrastination.</h2>
        <p><em><time datetime="2025-07-30">Posted on July 30, 2025</time></em></p>
        <p>
          I’ve not been able to set my head straight to actually be productive. I’ve just not been able to produce the things on my list.
          I’ve been working on a website that deals with a house bidding — to help sell a house. It’s available at 
          <a href="https://julien.raphaelreck.com" target="_blank">julien.raphaelreck.com</a>. I'll be getting 400 Euros for making it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was nice to work with AI to code the website and generate prompts. It works, but nothing extraordinary.
          Still, it might open other opportunities — I have a meeting with a potential client. Just sent him a quotation for a website.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also revisited an old project: a smart mirror core with AI — the idea is to display workout images, with a timer and a motion detector to guide home workouts in front of a mirror.
          I only have a Raspberry Pi so far. It’s early days, but the idea lives. <br> I saw this video recently. <br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8dx7ZimArc"> Building a Smart Morning Routine Dashboard (From a Jailbroken Lululemon Mirror) </a> I really like what they did. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Other than that, I still need to finalize the Roots Time Corporation manifesto and upload the memes I like (and remade) to the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          I managed just before leaving the office for my holidays to deliver some code for the client for them to test. Working for the city of Marseille with old code and practices and databases is a pain. No Git....

        <h2>SVN/Git Wrangling, Laravel Rage, and CET Headaches</h2>
        <p><em><time datetime="2025-07-06"></time>Posted on July 6, 2025</time></em></p>

        <p>This week was chaos and cleanup. Here's the damage:</p>

        <h3>Git vs SVN: The Migration No One Wants to Do</h3>
        <p>
          Tried migrating an old SVN project (AzurAgent) to GitLab. Did care about the history — just wanted to mirror the damn folder structure.
          But Git decided to throw a tantrum: thought I was deleting files instead of moving them. Line endings (CRLF/LF) made diffs unreadable. Classic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lesson: Git doesn't forgive structural violence. Plan your moves like a game of chess, or prepare to revert everything with tears in your eyes.
        </p>

        <h3>Laravel: The Bidding Site and Codex Fatigue</h3>
        <p>
          I pushed live a Laravel app generated by Codex — a bidding system for a house. Deployed it at 
          <a href="https://julien.raphaelreck.com" target="_blank">julien.raphaelreck.com</a>.
        </p>
        <p>This was my first time using Laravel for a project. Thanks GPT.</p>
        <p>Issues, as expected:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Root URL 404'd even though child routes worked.</li>
          <li>Images failed to load — turns out the photos folder wasn’t in <code>/public</code>.</li>
          <li>Codex-generated registration form had no validation for phone or email. No feedback. No regex. Just vibes.</li>
          <li>Dropdown fields broke silently. Inspect, guess, cry, repeat.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Reminder: Don’t trust AI scaffolding tools to finish the job. They're good starters — but lazy interns if left alone.
        </p>

        <h3>CET Form: Webservice Shenanigans in Production</h3>
        <p>
          On the AzurAgent side, we pushed the CET webform to VA for live testing. Tried to submit a 5-day annual leave transfer — frontend looked fine, but backend didn’t call the WS or trigger the fallback email.
        </p>
        <p>Suspected areas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Silent WS push failure (PUSH_DEMANDE_ACTIONCET)</li>
          <li>Fallback notification logic not firing</li>
          <li>No way to trace unless I dig through VA logs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Deployed, tested, and now chasing ghosts. It works locally. On VA? Shrugs.
        </p>

        <h3>Final Thought: Stop the Framework Madness</h3>
        <p>
          Every time I touch a framework, something breaks that HTML never asked for. Bloat creeps in. Pages slow down. Errors multiply.
          We used to build websites. Now we build excuses.
        </p>
        <p>If you want something to work — <strong>keep it simple</strong>.</p>

        <p style="font-family: monospace; color: gray;">
          // no JS frameworks were harmed in the making of this log

          <p>Old thought</p>
          <p>
        I believe the web should be simple. I don’t like frameworks. They bloat, obfuscate, and complicate things that HTML already did well decades ago.
        The more we "frame" "work", the more tedious life becomes. <br>More stepping over things to actually get to the source of what you want. 
        It's like climbing through a window each time.
