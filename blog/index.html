        Welcome to my log. I document things here — bugs, ideas, architecture wins, AI ramblings, time audits, and the occasional philosophical spiral.

      <p>
        I believe the web should be simple. I don’t like frameworks. They bloat, obfuscate, and complicate things that HTML already did well decades ago.
        The more we "frame" "work", the more tedious life becomes. More stepping over things to actually get to the source of what you want. 
        It's like climbing through a window each time.

        <h2>Log: SVN/Git Wrangling, Laravel Rage, and CET Headaches (July 2–6)</h2>
        <p><em>Posted on July 6, 2025</em></p>

        <p>This week was chaos and cleanup. Here's the damage:</p>

        <h3>Git vs SVN: The Migration No One Wants to Do</h3>
        <p>
          Tried migrating an old SVN project (AzurAgent) to GitLab. Did care about the history — just wanted to mirror the damn folder structure.
          But Git decided to throw a tantrum: thought I was deleting files instead of moving them. Line endings (CRLF/LF) made diffs unreadable. Classic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lesson: Git doesn't forgive structural violence. Plan your moves like a game of chess, or prepare to revert everything with tears in your eyes.
        </p>

        <h3>Laravel: The Bidding Site and Codex Fatigue</h3>
        <p>
          I pushed live a Laravel app generated by Codex — a bidding system for a house. Deployed it at 
          <a href="https://julien.raphaelreck.com" target="_blank">julien.raphaelreck.com</a>.
        </p>
        <p>This was my first time using Laravel for a project. Thanks GPT.</p>
        <p>Issues, as expected:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Root URL 404'd even though child routes worked.</li>
          <li>Images failed to load — turns out the photos folder wasn’t in <code>/public</code>.</li>
          <li>Codex-generated registration form had no validation for phone or email. No feedback. No regex. Just vibes.</li>
          <li>Dropdown fields broke silently. Inspect, guess, cry, repeat.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Reminder: Don’t trust AI scaffolding tools to finish the job. They're good starters — but lazy interns if left alone.
        </p>

        <h3>CET Form: Webservice Shenanigans in Production</h3>
        <p>
          On the AzurAgent side, we pushed the CET webform to VA for live testing. Tried to submit a 5-day annual leave transfer — frontend looked fine, but backend didn’t call the WS or trigger the fallback email.
        </p>
        <p>Suspected areas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Silent WS push failure (PUSH_DEMANDE_ACTIONCET)</li>
          <li>Fallback notification logic not firing</li>
          <li>No way to trace unless I dig through VA logs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Deployed, tested, and now chasing ghosts. It works locally. On VA? Shrugs.
        </p>

        <h3>Final Thought: Stop the Framework Madness</h3>
        <p>
          Every time I touch a framework, something breaks that HTML never asked for. Bloat creeps in. Pages slow down. Errors multiply.
          We used to build websites. Now we build excuses.
        </p>
        <p>If you want something to work — <strong>keep it simple</strong>.</p>
