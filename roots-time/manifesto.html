    <section class="prologue">
      <h2>Are Corporations Human?</h2>
      <p>
        They behave like entities. They speak, sue, own, consume, and influence.<br />
        But unlike humans, they cannot feel shame. They cannot weep. They do not die of old age.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Roots Time was created to flip that script</strong> — to act with conscience, humility, and care.<br />
        A corporation with a soul is not a contradiction.<br />
        It’s a necessity.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Corporations Shape the World</h2>
      <p>
        They influence laws, funnel wealth, and redefine progress according to their own metrics. They optimize for growth, not wisdom. Efficiency, not dignity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Roots Time Corporation was born in response.</strong><br />
        Not to compete — but to <em>counter</em>. Not to extract — but to <em>repair</em>.<br />
        We believe it’s time for a corporation that works <strong>for humanity</strong>, not just within the system — but around it, beneath it, and eventually beyond it.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Rooted in Intention</h2>
      <p>
        We do not follow trends. We follow meaning.<br />
        Every project we accept is an act of alignment — with our values, with our craft, and with the people we serve.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Time as a Sacred Resource</h2>
      <p>
        We don’t sell hours — we <strong>protect time</strong>.<br />
        We believe in slow processes, deep work, and quiet mornings over meetings.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “Money is the 6th sense that allows you to enjoy the other five.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        We are not here to hoard that sixth sense — we use it to support the others: to see clearly, taste life fully, feel deeply, hear truth, and move with purpose.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Code as Resistance</h2>
      <p>
        Our code isn’t a product. It’s a tool of independence.<br />
        We build with minimalism, durability, and human readability in mind.<br />
        No tech hype, no bloated stacks, no vendor lock-ins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Roots Time favors tools that free, not trap.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Digital Sovereignty</h2>
      <p>
        We empower creators, artists, cooperatives, and small businesses to own their digital space — on their own terms.<br />
        Self-hosted, privacy-respecting, transparent.<br />
        Digital doesn’t have to mean dependent.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Human-First, Always</h2>
      <p>
        No growth is worth a soul.<br />
        We value clear communication, emotional honesty, and saying “no” when needed.<br />
        Roots Time is small by design — to stay <strong>close to people and principles</strong>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why “Roots Time”?</h2>
      <p>
        Because the future is not built by rushing forward.<br />
        It is built by remembering what matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        We put down roots.<br />
        We take our time.<br />
        We help others do the same.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="transparency">
      <h2>Transparency is Strength</h2>
      <p>
        Our pricing is <strong>open source</strong>.<br />
        No hidden fees. No secret upsells. Just clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        You know what you’re paying for — and why.<br />
        Because trust doesn’t scale with opacity. It grows from honesty.
